1. Dynamic Programming, Recursivity: Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

Q1:
The initial elements are a pair of newborn baby rabbits at month 1. The recurrence relation of the Fibonacci sequence Fn is :
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 
I have heard about Fibonacci recurrence relation before in the exact same example. Last year our computer science teacher showed us this example in the Rosalind exercises list. 

Q2:
Can be found in the Python script.
